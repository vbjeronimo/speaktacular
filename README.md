# Speaktacular
Speaktacular is a web application that aims to help users improve their pronunciation of English words by using the power of Web Speech API. 

## The Idea
At some point during university, I thought it would be great if there was a way to practice speaking, in the same way we can practice typing.
And since I couldn't find any tools online that could do this, I tried to create my own.

With Speaktacular, the user could write a piece of text on the practice page, enable their microphone, and read out loud the words that they
wrote. The app would then compare the words that they spoke with the text that they provided and see if both match, displaying to the user the
words that were missing, that were spoken incorrectly, or any extra words that were not in the text.

## Why the project has been archived
My course load got very heavy on my last year of university (when I started this project), and I couldn't find time to work on it anymore, and
after a while I lost interest in working on it.

I might unarchive it and resume my work eventually, but not anytime soon.
